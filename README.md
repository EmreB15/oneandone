# Task 2
Open index.html in your browser. Its a simple calculator that should add up two numbers and display the total. 

There is a problem with it, currently if you  try to add two numbers it returns both numbers. eg 5+5 =55

Have a play around with it and see if you can fix the problem to return total of two numbers. eg 5+5 =10

There is also some css in this file feel free to play around with it and try to understand what is happening.
